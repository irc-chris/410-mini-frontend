The file to edit the main displayed page is within Components. This produces a component that page.tsx imports and then displays as a React Component.

Component files are in Components
Manager files (those that will end up interacting with the backend) are in DataManagers.

To work on the project please:
1. Make a branch for ur component
2. Find the file corresponding the the task you selected.
3. Work in that file according to the specification.
4. Make a pull request when you think your code is good to merge (have a TL approve it)
5. Complete the merge
